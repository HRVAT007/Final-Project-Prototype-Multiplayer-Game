# UCN 5th semester project - Final Project Prototype Multiplayer Game
## Abstract
This repository contains the code for my 5th semester project for Computer Science degree at UCN. The premise of the project is to design a game in C# with as much of the code as possible to be reusable in another game project in the future.

Final Project Prototype Multiplayer Game is a game in which players are tasked with surviving a wave of zombies without dying.

## Project set-up

2. Download and install Unity Hub.
3. Add it to a list of projects and install the required Unity Engine version
4. Open the project and press start and everything should be ready to go.
